        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <p>
          The familiar game of Rock, Paper, Scissors is played like this: at the
          same time, two players display one of three symbols: a rock, paper, or
          scissors. A rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper by cutting it,
          and paper beats rock by covering it.
          <br />
          Rock, paper, scissors is an example of a zero-sum game without perfect
          information. Whenever one player wins, the other loses. We can express
          this game using a payoff matrix that explains what one player gains
          with each strategy the players use. In the payoff matrix below, the
          rows represent player 1's possible strategies while the columns
          represent computer's possible strategies. 1 represents a win for
          player 1, 0 a tie, and -1 a loss for player 1. So, for instance, the
          upper left entry is a 0 because if both players display rocks, they
          tie. The upper middle entry is a -1 because if player 1 displays a
          rock and computer displays paper, computer wins, and therefore, player
          1 loses.
